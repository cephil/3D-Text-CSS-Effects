<!-- NOTES -->
<!-- Yes... this needs clean up, bad. This is mostly out of boredom, and some inspiration browsing codepen for ideas while waiting on recruiters and employment opportunities.

It's funny, all I've met in the last couple of months are people who loathe CSS -- and honestly, I don't find it to be all that difficult? Especially when you can do cool stuff like this!

Anyway, feel free to use any of this and consider it MIT License -- it's just CodePen anyway :). I'll keep making more when I get bored!

Thanks!

Phil
